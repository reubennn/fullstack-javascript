# Learning Full-Stack JavaScript Development: MongoDB, Node, and React

Learn by doing! Learn full-stack JavaScript development by building a web application with MongoDB, Node.js, and React.js.

Learn how to use Node as a web server and an API server, how to consume data and build user interfaces with React, and how to read and write data with a MongoDB database. React allows you to build full-featured, data-driven applications faster and more efficiently than what is possible with JavaScript alone.

Samer Buna introduces modern JavaScript programming concepts, with an emphasis on functional methods and open-source tools. The lessons are almost completely hands-on, with live coding demonstrations that bring the concepts home.
